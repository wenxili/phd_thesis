Another somewhat annoying "feature" of Zotero is that when exporting to bibtex, it automatically sets the key for you. Many people have preferred key styles. This introduces two problems - for old references, you want your old key, not an autogenerated one, secondly, for new references, you would like the key in "your style". The second problem is relatively easily solved:

   1. Find the file: ~/.mozilla/XXXXXXX/zotero/translators/BibTeX.js, where XXXXXXXX will be some random string
   2. The line to change is:
      var citeKeyFormat = "%a_%t_%y";
      For example, I changed it to
      var citeKeyFormat = "%a%y%t";
      %a is first author, %t is first word from title, %y is the year.
   3. I also prefer two digit years. For as long as I can foresee myself living, 2 digit years are sufficient. To "fix" this, change the line with date.year (line 1848 in the version when this was written) to:
      return date.year.toString().substring(2);
   4. You can also use another field if you prefer, e.g. call number, by changing
      var citekey = buildCiteKey(item, citekeys);
      to
      var citekey = item.callNumber;
