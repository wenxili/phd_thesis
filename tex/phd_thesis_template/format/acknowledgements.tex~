First to many people who helped me and contributed to shape this thesis, I owe them all a debt of gratitude. Those listed below deserve special mention and thanks.

My sincere thanks to Dr. Hammadi Nait-Charif and Prof. Jian J Zhang, my supervisors, who supervised my work from the very beginning â€“ from collection of vague ideas to the completion of the thesis as it stands now; for their guidance, advice, and criticisms during this work and moreover, their encouragement when I feel low.

I am sure without support from my mom Mandhari Poudel and Anita this would be simply not possible. I owe you both a depth of gratitude. And really really really miss you Dad- Khim Lal Poudel.

My thanks goes to my colleagues at University Lab, in particular Chung, Denis, Jose, Sola, Richard, Safa, Tauheed, Wenxi and last but not least research administrator Jan Lewis. 

My special thanks to Bournemouth University for BU Studenship to support my PhD work.
